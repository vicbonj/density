Mail: victor.bonjean@obspm.fr



A code to perform density maps in 2d or in 3d with a distribution of points in inputs.


- Download the ipython notebook and the file pydtfe.py and put it in the same folder.
- Run the notebook with the command "jupyter-notebook"
- Test the example and create your own maps with your own distribution of points !

For visualisation of 3d maps, you can use the library "mayavi" in python (http://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/)

--- In terms of compatibility, it's better to have the environment Anaconda (https://anaconda.org) installed on your computer ---
